### `(entangle-register-write! entangle fd thunk)`

Register the file descriptor `FD` with `ENTANGLE`. When `FD` is ready
to be *written*, when `entangle-continue` is called `THUNK` will be
called.

> Warning: You can not register the same file descriptor twice with
> the same read or write event type.
