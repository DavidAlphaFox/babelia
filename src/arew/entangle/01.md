### `(entangle-register-read! entangle fd thunk)`

Register the file descriptor `FD` with `ENTANGLE`. When `FD` is ready
to be *read*, and when `entangle-continue` is called, `THUNK` will be
called.

> Warning: You can not register the same file descriptor twice with
> the same read or write event type.
