### `(untangle-channel-recv channel)`

Return a Scheme object from `CHANNEL`.

Whether `untangle-channel-recv` is called from a POSIX thread or a
green thread, the thread may be paused to wait until a Scheme object
is sent inside `CHANNEL`. If there is an object in the inbox of
`CHANNEL` the thread will proceed immediatly. Both behaviors are
implicit. From user perspective, it does not matter whether the thread
is paused or not. What matters is that a green thread *may* be paused.
