### `(untangle-channel-recv channel)`

Return a Scheme object from `CHANNEL`. If that object satisfy
`untangle-closing?` it means that associated `CHANNEL` will stop
running.

Whether `untangle-channel-recv` is called from a POSIX thread or a
green thread, the thread may be paused to wait until a Scheme object
is sent inside the `CHANNEL`. If there is an object waiting in
`CHANNEL` the thread will proceed immediatly. Both behaviors are
implicit. From user perspective, it does not matter whether the thread
is paused or not. What matters is that a green thread *may* be paused.
