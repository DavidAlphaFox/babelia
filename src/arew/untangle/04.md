### `(untangle-time untangle)`

Return an exact integer representing event-loop's time in
nanoseconds. It is monotonically increasing. It can not be related to
world clock.

It is only reliable to compare the return value of two calls of
`untangle-time` to know if some amount of time has passed, such as:


```scheme
(fx>? 1000 (fx- (untangle-time untangle) start))
```

The above will return `#t` when at least 1000 nanoseconds have passed
since `start` was attributed.

It is useful to implement timeout behaviors.
