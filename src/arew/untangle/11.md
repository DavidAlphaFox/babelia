### `(untangle-closing? obj)`

If `OBJ` is the untangle closing singleton return `#t`. Otherwise,
return `#f`.

The untangle closing singleton is returned by `untangle-channel-recv`,
`untangle-channel-send`, and `untangle-channel-select` when
`untangle-stop` on the untangle associated with the channel. When the
caller receive that object, it should finish and shutdown itself.
