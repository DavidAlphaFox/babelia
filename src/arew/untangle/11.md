### `(untangle-closing? obj)`

If `OBJ` is the untangle closing singleton return `#t`. Otherwise,
return `#f`.

The untangle closing singleton is returned by `untangle-channel-recv`,
`untangle-channel-send`, and `untangle-channel-select` when the
associated channel's event-loop was stoped with `untangle-stop`.

When the caller receive that object, it should finish and shutdown
itself.
