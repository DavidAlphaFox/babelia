### `(untangle-start untangle)`

Start `UNTANGLE`.

> **Warning:** Starting the same `untangle` twice is unspecified.

All the thunks that were previously added with `untangle-spawn` will
be executed. At this point they are called *green thread*.  A green
thread, or thunk if you prefer, may be paused when calling:

- `untangle-sleep`
- `untangle-channel-recv`
- `untangle-channel-recv*`
- the generator returned by `untangle-generator`
- the accumulator returned by `untangle-accumulator`

If prior to the call of `untangle-start` no thunks were spawned,
`untangle-start` returns immediatly.

You may call `untangle-stop` to **ask** the event-loop to shutdown.
