### `(make-untangle-channel untangle)`

Create a unidirectional communication channel. The channel can be used
for communication between green threads, or POSIX threads, or
both. Multiple threads can operate safetly on the same channel.

A channel can be used with the following procedures:

- `untangle-channel-recv`
- `untangle-channel-send`
- `untangle-channel-select`

The channel is loosly associated to the event-loop `UNTANGLE`. A
channel may be passed from one thread to another thread (green or
POSIX). If `UNTANGLE` is stoped with `unstangle-stop`, the channel
will stop processing receving, or sending, and notify the calling
thread that it is closing with a specific return value.
