## `(arew untangle)`

`untangle` is cooperative event-loop that does not expose
continuations (aka. callbacks) and where procedures are [not
colored](https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2015/02/01/what-color-is-your-function/). That can be achieved thanks to `call/cc`.

> necessary to use this library.

Until things like
[`io_uring`](https://thenewstack.io/how-io_uring-and-ebpf-will-revolutionize-programming-in-linux/)
are mainstream, `untangle` only expose the asynchronous support of BSD
sockets from the kernel.

`untangle` high-level interface expose generators and accumulators to
respectively read from and write into sockets. Both TCP and UDP
sockets are supported. In particular, Scheme's port interface is not
supported by this library.

`untangle` support the execution of CPU-bound procedures or other
blocking procedure in POSIX threads, possibly relying on a pool of
threads.

On top of `untangle` is implemented the HTTP library `hyperserver`.

This library exposes two new types, with constructor and predicate:

- `make-untangle`, and `untangle?`
- `make-untangle-channel` and `untangle-channel?`

### `(make-untangle-socket domain type protocol)`

### `(untangle-accept socket)`

### `(untangle-bind socket)`

### `(untangle-listen socket)`

### `(untangle-socket-generator socket)`

### `(untangle-socket-accumulator socket)`
