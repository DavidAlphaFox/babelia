# Babelia Administrator Manual

## Introduction

Babelia is a privacy friendly, decentralized, open source, and
accessible search engine.

Search has been an essential part of knowledge acquisition from the
dawn of time, whether it is antique lexicographically ordered filing
cabinets or nowadays computer-based wonders such as Google or
Bing. From casual search to help achieve common tasks such as cooking,
keeping up with the news, a regular dose of cat memes or professional
search such as science research. Search is, and will remain, an
essential daily-use tool, that stires human progress forward.

Babelia aims to replace the use of privateer search engines with a
search engine that is open, hence under the control of the commons.

Eventually, Babelia may offer features commonly associated with
existing search engines, such as maps, mail accounts, calendars, image
and video galleries, and a feed reader inside a single software.
Babelia wants to be an easy to install, easy to use, easy to maintain,
no-code, personal search engine that can scale to billions of
documents, beyond a terabyte of text data, for under â‚¬100 a month per
Babelia instance.
